# Wireless Communication Parameters Calculator
## Project Overview
This project involves designing and building an online calculator for various wireless communication parameters. The calculator will help in calculating:

1. The number of bits and rate of the sampler, quantizer, source encoder, channel encoder, and interleaver.
2. The number of bits and rate for resource elements, OFDM symbol, Resource Blocks, and maximum transmission using parallel resource blocks.
3. Power transmitted in a flat environment based on transmitter and receiver specifications.
4. Throughput in percent of Multiple Access techniques.
5. Design of a cellular system.
